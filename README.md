# <My Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

I created this study guide to familiarize myself with the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. Building this allowed me to have a hands-on leanring experience before class starts. Doing so has given me a better understanding of how the elements of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript come together.
